Cookie-Monster
==============
The Solution has 3 Projects in the game so far. The First is our game or test game with the intent to test the code in the 
engine to see if it works properly. It is called Engine Tester. This is the place where all our game specific code will be
written using the classes in engine for most of the logic. This Project also contains the content folder that has all the 
maps and textures, sound and level's.

The Second Soulution is our Editor for the Sage Eng, This has all the code for the editor to create Levels and dynamic files
that will be used in the game.

The Final project is our enigne that will contain all the logic and effect.

Please make sure that you keep the code well maintained and Organised. Add Logical comments at proper Intervals. Also
keep the code updates Information Clear, Write Long paragraphs if you have.
